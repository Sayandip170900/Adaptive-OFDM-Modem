# Adaptive-OFDM-Modem
This is a demonstration of an Adaptive Modem based on OFDM. The simulation chooses the type of modulation based on the channel condition.

OFDM.m File performs Adaptive Modulation based on the SNR value entered by the user and the specified channel conditions.

OFDM2.m File is a modified version of the code where custom modulation techniques can be tested out by custom channel conditions. Comment statements are there is the code to guide the user through each and every custom process.
